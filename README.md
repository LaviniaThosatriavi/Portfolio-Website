# Scrolling Parallax Responsive Portfolio-Website

This repository contains the code for my professional portfolio website, highlighting my personal experiences. Background images are sourced from carefully curated public free domains.

## Features

- **Scrolling Parallax**: Provide an immersive and dynamic browsing experience with a scrolling parallax effect. Background elements move at different speeds based on the scroll position., creating a visually engaging effect.

- **Responsive Web Design**: Ensure optimal viewing experience across various devices. The website dynamically adjusts its layout and design to provide seamless navigation and readability on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

- **Captivating Hover Effects**: Enhance interactivity and user engagement with visually appealing hover effects applied to buttons, links, and images. These effects add an extra layer of interaction and delight.

### How It Works

Coded javascript attaches an event handler to the `onscroll` event of the `window` object. This means that whenever the user scrolls the page, the specified code will be executed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: Markup language for structuring the website's content and layout.
- CSS3: Styling language for designing the website, including responsive layouts and captivating hover effects.
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity and enhances the functionality of the website.
